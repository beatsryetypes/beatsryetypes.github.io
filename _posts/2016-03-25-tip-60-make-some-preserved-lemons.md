Preserved lemons are made by submerging lemons, their juice, salt, and other spices in a jar, and then waiting. Waiting is the magic ingredient in many of our favorite foods, from pizza dough to pickles and beyond, and preserved lemons are really, really magical. When they come out of the jar they are soft, the peel is edible, they are salty, sweet, sour, pungent, and awesome. They can brighten up vegetables like roast broccoli, can adorn grilled fish, or can be made into a heavier accompaniment to something like lamb or goat. <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016212-preserved-lemons">This recipe in the New York Times</a> shows how easy it is. If you can't make them, they're available in specialty shops or online and are very, very worth it.
