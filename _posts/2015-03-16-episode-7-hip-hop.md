  As the snow begins to melt, we start dreaming about summertime and when we dream about summertime, we start thinking about the official music of summertime. We talk about what our first introductions to Hip Hop were, going deep in to underground in the late 90s, diverge into Jazz and what _our_ children will be listening to.
