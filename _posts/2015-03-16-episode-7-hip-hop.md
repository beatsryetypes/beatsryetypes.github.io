summary: |
  As the snow begins to melt, we start dreaming about summertime and when we dream about summertime, we start thinking about the season's official music: Hip-Hop. We talk about what our first introductions to Hip-Hop were, go deep into the late 90s underground, and finally diverge into Jazz and what _our_ children will be listening to.
