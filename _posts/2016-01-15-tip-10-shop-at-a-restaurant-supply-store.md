Cooking can seem like an awfully expensive hobby sometimes, one that is relegated to people willing to buy very expensive equipment to use in their very expensive houses.

Most major cities have these stores and they're usually open to the public. This beautiful Japanese mandoline, which has only claimed a few of my fingertips at this point, is an example of a tool I use all the time that I got at a restaurant supply store for much less than the shitty Oxo version would have cost me at the mall.
