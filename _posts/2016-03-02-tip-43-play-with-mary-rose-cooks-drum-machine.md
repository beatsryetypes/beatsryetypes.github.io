<a href="http://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a> helped build and shape one of our favorite institutions, <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse Center</a>, which is renowned for empowering individuals to do amazing things with computers. Mary herself is no slouch with computers, giving talks that are often live-coding high-wire acts: building games, drum machines, small programming languages, you name it. Mary recently released <a href="http://drum-machine.maryrosecook.com/">A pure JavaScript Drum Machine</a> that weighs in at a hefty 114 lines of code - heavily annotated. Creative code projects like this are difficult to pull off, but Mary has produced something fun to use with a pedagogical implementation that you can actually learn from. Check out the talk, play with the toy itself, and study the code.*

*By playing with this drum machine on our recommendation, you hereby promise to pay Beats, Rye, & Types a royalty of 5% on any club bangers you create with this technology.*
