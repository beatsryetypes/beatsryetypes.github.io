In our quest to indoctrinate everyone into the various oddball corners of music from different parts of the world, we fear we haven't done enough to promote some of our favorite musicians: Germans. To rectify that, today we're recommending that you drop everything and listen to Harmonia's 1974 masterpiece "Musik von Harmonia." Composed of Cluster's Moebius and Roedelius and Neu's Michael Rother, the group set out to the country, built a studio, and made two albums that sound unlike anything you've heard before. Describing music is useless, so just trust us - you should check this out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3Jyh6Yc38WaDFATs9krqXz">[SPOTIFY LINK]
