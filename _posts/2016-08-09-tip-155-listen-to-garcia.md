Considering how much Grateful Dead we've listened to over the years, we're pretty proud of ourselves for not constantly telling you to listen to them. On today, the anniversary of Jerry Garcia's death, though, we couldn't resist getting pretty close. Jerry Garcia was a prolific musician outside of his work with the Grateful Dead, jamming constantly with bluegrass musicians, jazz musicians, psychedelic rock musicians, etc. His solo albums, much like the studio work of the Dead, are not very well known or appreciated, but we love them. Garcia's first LP is a shining example of the singular vision and contains everything from his take on Dead tunes to instrumental experimental mayhem. Listen and appreciate and remember Garcia today by jamming this classic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2W4eUPaHq07fv6PlpdoP3B">[Spotify Link Here]</a>
