`#tbt` To coming home after school and spending my parents money to order [Grand Puba ft. Mary J Blige - Check It Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8P8f4JArmo) on the Box.

Grand Puba is probably better known for his work with Brand Nubian, one of the defining groups of NY Hip-Hop in the early 90s along with Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. [This album](https://open.spotify.com/album/7apnvHdc8HPDuVnR3mp49O), though, is one of my all time favorites and for me, perfectly captures a moment in music. From the sparse, sample driven beats, to the group of g's shouting a chorus, to a very young Mary J. Blige riffing over [The Honey Drippers](http://www.discogs.com/Honey-Drippers-Impeach-The-President-Roy-Cs-Theme/release/797856). Just listen to it, it will make your dreary Thursday a little more fun.

And if you don't know what the Box is ... that's a whole other conversation.
