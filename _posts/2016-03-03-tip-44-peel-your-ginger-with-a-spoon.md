Ginger is one of our favorite ingredients, but it's one that took us a while to learn how to work with properly. Storing, peeling, grating, and cooking with ginger all offer their own subtle annoyances. You know that ginger is a powerful, beautiful ingredient based on that fact alone - it's such a pain in the ass to work with! Fortunately, we can help. When you're looking at a fresh hand of ginger and wondering how to peel it, the answer isn't to use a knife or some other fancy appliance. All you need is a spoon! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9zgXSdnPGI">This video from Gourmet Magazine</a> illustrates the technique perfectly. Now go forth and peel your ginger with impunity, and think about it this way - it's still a pain in the ass to work with, but at least you can get the skin off now!
