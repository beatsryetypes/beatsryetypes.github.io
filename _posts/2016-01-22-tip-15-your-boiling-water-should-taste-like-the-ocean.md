When you are boiling pasta or blanching any kind of vegetable, you have the opportunity to season that food while you cook it. Pasta that is cooked in heavily salted water emerges full of flavor and ready to take just the lightest amount of sauce to take it where it needs to go. Vegetables blanched in water that is almost a brine are screaming for a tiny bit of oil or butter and that's it. The lesson here is that the way to make food that has the right amount of seasoning all the way through is to take every opportunity to season and taste, season and taste. And so we say:

> "Salt your boiling water until it tastes like the ocean."

Try it and you'll see that your food will start to have that little something extra you never knew was missing.
