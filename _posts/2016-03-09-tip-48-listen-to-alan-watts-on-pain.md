<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">Alan Watts</a> was a philosopher and culturally influential figure who made it his mission to explain, amongst other things, Buddhism in a way that made sense to 20th century Americans. Watts lectured publicly on a regular basis and also recorded some lectures for television station KQED in 1959. From that series, <a href="https://archive.org/details/AlanWatts-Pain-Kqed-1959">this lecture on 'Pain'</a> is a good place to start with Watts' work, and is a gentle introduction to some very deep ideas. The connection between pain and fear, how we cope in modern life, and how we connect to ideas larger than we can comprehend -- typical rumination for a Wednesday.
