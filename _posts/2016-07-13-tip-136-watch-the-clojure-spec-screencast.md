Those kooky Clojureists are always up to something, aren't they? This time, they've introduced a library called `Spec` which does ... a lot. It's an amazing and innovative take on connecting the threads of testing, documentation, and data driven programming concepts, and that doesn't really do at all an adequate job of describing what is cool about this technology. Instead of listening to us, <a href="http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/7/13/screencast-spec-leverage">listen to Stuart Halloway, a Clojure mainstay, explain how the whole thing works</a>, and give it a shot. New perspectives in language design can be mind-explanding to learn about when they are well executed, and we like this one a lot. We hope you will too.
