Seymour Papert recently passed away and we were taken aback by the depth and quality of his work once again. He was a deeply compassionate and intelligent person whose contributions to computing are indelibly written in its history, forever.

Honor him and <a href="http://www.papert.org/works.html">read his works here</a>.
