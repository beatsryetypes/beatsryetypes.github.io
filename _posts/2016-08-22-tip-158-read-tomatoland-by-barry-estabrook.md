We've been fan's of Barry Estabrook's writing since his [politics of the plate series at _Gourmet_](http://www.gourmet.com/profiles/barry_estabrook/search462a.html?contributorName=Barry%20Estabrook). We finally read [_Tomatoland_](http://amzn.to/2byYse6) recently and it also did not disappoint. We've always held a grudge against those poor facsimiles for tomatoes that we get at the super market in the winter - little did we know how deep the rabbit whole went. This isn't just about conspiracy theories or righteous 'locavorism' its a tale about how far removed a single vegetable can get from its ideal. Read it now in the season when you can still get the good tomatoes from the farmers market.
