We admit it. After living in New York City so long, we've become spoiled. We're used to having everything at our fingertips, and having to travel or order things on the internet instead of walking there rankles us a bit. It's okay, we're fine. We're working on it. One thing that helps us get through these troubling times is access, via the internet, to Kalustyan's. <a href="https://www.kalustyans.com/">Kalustyan's is the ultimate New York City destination for any kind of obscure dried, pickled, or in any way preserved food thing you might need</a>. Szechuan peppercorns. Dried barberries. Dark, delicious pickled roots in jars you've never heard of. Also, awesome cocktail supplies. You name it. Going to the mothership itself and eating lunch in the second floor "cafe" is highly recommended, but for those of us who can't go in person, visit their site and order some stuff. Most of the cookbooks we've recommended require some ingredients that most of us just can't find locally, and Kalustyan's is an awesome establishment to hit up for that kinda thing.
