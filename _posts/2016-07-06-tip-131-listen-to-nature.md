We first heard the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Krause">Bernard "Bernie" Krause</a> back in our crate digging days - he was half of the famed Beaver & Krause, the synthesizer pioneers whose samples were highly sought after by hip-hop musicians. Fast forward 20 years and we hear about Krause again in a very different capacity - <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151006-nature-sounds-science-animals-music/">his pioneering work in creating the field known as 'soundscape ecology'</a>. Krause records and inspires others to record the sounds of nature in various settings in order to determine, among other things, the impact that humanity has on an ecosystem. Studying the world through sound is a beautiful idea with strong science behind it - it turns out you can tell a lot by listening. Check out Krause's work, including a book on the subject, and spend more time listening - you never know what you'll hear.
