In our frequent wanderings through [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) in search of new music, we recently stumbled on [The Black Jesus Experience's new album _Cradle of Humanity_](https://blackjesusexperience.bandcamp.com/album/cradle-of-humanity). It truly captured our attention because of the primary name on the cover, legendary vibes player and progenitor of Ethiojazz [Mulatu Astatke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulatu_Astatke). This new album blends some of our favorite Astatke originals with new instrumentation and even some hip hop lyricism. Sometimes the combination of rap and jazz can feel forced and tired, but sometimes, as here, it feels fresh and interesting. For some reason, it just works.
