Joe McPhee's 1970 live album "Nation Time" is a legendary holy grail LP that captures the essence of everything that is so amazing and powerful about Jazz, America's first and greatest original art form. America is as complicated and broken in many ways in 2016 as it was when this album was recorded, but there is hope, as always, in music. Shout NATION TIME along with McPhee, take this music in, and let yourself be healed, at least a little bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6uAkgTCAvYNrGJrG6SaZV3">[Spotify Link Here]</a>
