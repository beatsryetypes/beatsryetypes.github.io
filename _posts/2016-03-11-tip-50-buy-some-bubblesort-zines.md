*By the way we're super stoked because this is ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Tip #50! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰*

One of the pillars of Beats, Rye, & Types is **ABL - Always Be Learning** (catchy, right?). We like to learn about all sorts of things - cooking, gardening, pottery, brains, and even computers. What keeps us coming back again and again to learning about computers is exemplified in <a href="http://twitter.com/sailorhg">Amy Wibowo's</a> amazing <a href="http://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/">BubbleSort Zines</a> - they are insightful, present information in new ways, and are often really funny. You can learn about calculators from <a href="http://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/products/how-do-calculators-even-zine">"How Do Calculators Even"</a>, about caching from <a href="http://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/products/cache-cats-dot-biz-zine">Cache Cats Dot Biz</a>, or just go nuts and buy <a href="http://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/products/12-month-subscription-to-bubble-sort-zines">twelve months worth with a subscription!</a>. Support Amy's awesome work and keep learning! It never gets old.
