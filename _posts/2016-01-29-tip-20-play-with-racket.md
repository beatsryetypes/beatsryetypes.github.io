<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> is a programming language in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp tradition</a> that is different from other programming languages in a few important ways. It can be any language you want - because Racket is heavily used for pedagogy, it has evolved into a suite of languages and tools that you can use to explore <a href="https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/paradigmsDIAGRAMeng108.pdf">as many different programming paradigms as you can think of</a>. You can also download it and play with it right now, without installing anything else, or knowing anything at all about computers or programming. Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayoofXuKqMY">Matthias Felleisen's "big-bang: the world, universe, and network in the programming language" talk</a> will give you an idea of how Racket can be used to help people learn how to think about mathematics, computation, and more. Try it out even if you "hate Lisp" or "don't know how to program" - it's really a lot of fun.
