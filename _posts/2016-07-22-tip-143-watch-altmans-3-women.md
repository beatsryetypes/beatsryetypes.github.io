<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman">Robert Altman</a> was one of America's greatest living artists. A filmmaker unlike any other, his takes on humanity, mystery, pain, love, and art were visually stunning, thought-provoking, and as deep as films get. We can't say enough good things about many of his films, but a recent tweet by a friend reminded us of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Women">"3 Women,"</a> and we can't recommend highly enough that you go and watch it immediately. A psychedelic and psychological masterpiece, "3 Women" traces relationships, personalities, and intrigue in a small desert town. Shelley Duvall, Sissy Spacek and Janice Rule give masterful performances, and the film couldn't be more beautiful. "3 Women" is a perfect for a summer night after a long day of soaking up sun - watch it, and we'll see you on the other side.
