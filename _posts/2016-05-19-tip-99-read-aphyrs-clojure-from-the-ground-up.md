Even though neither of us write [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) day-to-day, we're big fan's of its methodology and have learned many useful lessons just by reading and following along with some of it's experts and biggest proponents. One of our favorite resources for diving into it is our friend [Kyle's](https://twitter.com/aphyr) series [_Clojure from the ground up_](https://aphyr.com/tags/Clojure-from-the-ground-up). It's a great introduction regardless of skill level and does a great job of introducing some core concepts. The [post on debugging](https://aphyr.com/posts/319-clojure-from-the-ground-up-debugging) is one we reflect on often, not just for its walkthrough of tools but its extremely clear reference of what 'good debugging' is, regardless of platform.
