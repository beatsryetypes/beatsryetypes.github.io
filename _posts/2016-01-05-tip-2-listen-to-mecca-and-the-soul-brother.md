This isn't really a secret or mind-blowing revelation, more of just a reminder. [Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth - Mecca and The Soul Brother](https://open.spotify.com/album/2AgTKAULjbHpqqtyI53hdp) is without a doubt one of the greatest Hip-Hop albums of all time, and even though it's more than 20 years old, it still sounds fresh. As [we've discussed before](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/03/16/episode-7-hip-hop.html), Hip-hop is music that's followed us through our lives, and this album (and T.R.O.Y. in particular) has been around in our regular rotation for that whole time. It's worth listening from end-to-end not just for all the great verses but also all the little throw-away beats Pete Rock sticks between the tracks as an F.U. to every other producer out there ("I have so many beats, this one is just gonna play for 20 seconds"). We've been reminiscing over what Hip-Hop could be, and this album more than most.
