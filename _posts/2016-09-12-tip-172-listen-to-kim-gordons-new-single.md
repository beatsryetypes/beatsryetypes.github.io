Sonic Youth is one of our all-time favorite bands, and since the band's demise we've seen a lot of interesting activities from its members. While all of that material has been interesting, we are beyond stoked at the shape and sound of Kim Gordon's new single "Murdered Out." Here's what she has to say about it:

> "Black matte spray.

>  When I moved back to LA, I noticed more and more cars painted with black matte spray, tinted windows, blackened logos, and black wheels. This was something I had occasionally seen in the past, part of lowrider car culture. A reclaiming of a corporate symbol of American success, The Car, from an outsider’s point of view. A statement-making rejection of the shiny brand new look, the idea of a new start, the promise of power, and the freedom on the open road. Like an option on a voting ballot, "none of the above.”

>  "Murdered Out," as a look, is now creeping into mainstream culture as a design trend. A coffee brand. A clothing line. A nailpolish color.

>  Black-on-black matte is the ultimate expression in digging out, getting rid of, purging the soul. Like a black hole, the supreme inward look, a culture collapsing in on itself, the outsider as an unwilling participant as the "It" look.

It's fucking awesome. Jam it now. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvgRg_mUhtQ">[YouTube Link Here]</a>
