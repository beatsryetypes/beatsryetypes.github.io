_Continuing on the poet train ..._

The poet [Simone White](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/simone-white) [recently interviewed](http://bombmagazine.org/article/552369/vince-staples) one of our favorite artists of the moment, [Vince Staples](https://twitter.com/vincestaples?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for [BOMB magazine](http://bombmagazine.org/article/552369/vince-staples). Their conversation weaves in and out around ideas of fame, representation in music, and Vince's career. 

> VS I just hear the beat, and either it fits something or it doesn't. It's basically me looking for something, but I don't know what I'm looking for.

> VS Then we get a song. Sometimes I never find it. It's alright. Life goes on. We just go to the juice place or something. And then get a sandwich.

[It's a great and really interesting read](http://bombmagazine.org/article/552369/vince-staples).
