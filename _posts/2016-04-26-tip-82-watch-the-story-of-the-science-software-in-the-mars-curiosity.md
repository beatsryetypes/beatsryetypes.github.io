Like a lot of kids who grew up in the 80s we have always been space nerds. When NASA launched the [Curiosity Rover](http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/) to Mars almost 4 years ago, of course we were extremely excited. As software developers, we were were even more interested to hear about how these engineers solved the complex problems of running a remote moving laboratory on Mars. Recently, we found [this video of Dr. Kathryn Weiss, from the NASA JPL, describing some of the software challenges and solutions they used.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jVt5vb68xA) We love hearing about how different (but at the same time similar) building software for a rover is from our seemingly trivial work of building web applications is.
