Some times soul music doesn't have the same emotional connection without live performance. While we've been following Anthony Hamilton for a little while now, seeing him [perform with his band at NPR's Tiny Desk Series](http://www.npr.org/2016/03/24/471793830/anthony-hamilton-tiny-desk-concert) gave us a new appreciation of his music. You can truly _feel_ the music. Enjoy this short set and Hamilton's sweet cable knit USA sweater (Happy 4th!).
