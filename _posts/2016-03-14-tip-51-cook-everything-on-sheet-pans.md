We've told you before that we prefer to shop at restaurant supply shops over fancy brand name kitchen stores - they sell battle-tested equipment at a fraction of the cost that you'd spend at the mall. Now we'll let you in on one of our favorite things to stock up on when we hit the supply store - sheet pans. We cook everything from pizza to roasted vegetables to bacon and everything in-between on sheet pans. They're easy to clean (even easier if you make a habit of lining them with foil before you cook on them), easy to store (they usually fit in that weird drawer underneath your oven), and come in multiple sizes. Durable, repeatable, affordable, flexible - what more could you ask for? Go cop some sheet pans and thank us later.
