Last week we told you to eat more weeds - we hope you did. This week, despite madness all over the world, we have cause to celebrate. Celebration makes us think of flowers, and flowers, and like most things, flowers make us think of eating. It's hard for us to talk about eating flowers without thinking about one of our culinary heroes - Sarah Minnick of Portland's <a href="https://lovelysfiftyfifty.wordpress.com/>Lovely's</a>. Sarah is fearless with what she puts on top of pizzas, and one of the best tips we've gotten from her is to eat flowers! Chive flowers! Nasturtiums! All kinds! Many, many flowers from culinary plants are edible, delicious, and often considered garbage. Incredible. Give this a shot - make your next salad a rainbow with a handful of flowers from your neighborhood or from the farmer's market. Take some time to love the ones you're close with. Eat some fucking flowers already.
