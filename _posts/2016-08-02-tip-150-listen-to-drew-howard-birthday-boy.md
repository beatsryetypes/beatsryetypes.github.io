This summer has been all about listening to music from ["The 6"](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%206) - mainly because of [Drake's _Views_](https://open.spotify.com/album/2e42oY2oFArkkTENT8UVXD). It's led us to discover some awesome hip-hop including the stellar EP [_Music to Soothe the Savage Youth_ by Drew Howard & Birthday Boy (free on soundcloud)](https://soundcloud.com/birthdayboyofficial/sets/music-to-soothe-the-savage-youth). It has a ton of elements of the "OVO" sound, but still manages to sound unique, with a certain fist-pumping-in-the-club quality. It's the perfect music to get you through a hot and rainy Tuesday and maybe for your weekend trip.
