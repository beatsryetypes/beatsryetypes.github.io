Making simple pantry items like flavored sugar is an awesome way to enhance, extend, or preserve your favorite flavors. Whether it's the height of your favorite fruit's season or you stumble upon some particularly excellent vanilla beans, making flavored sugar could not be simpler, and when you're looking for that little extra something to make a dish or dessert excellent, it will be there for you. We like flavoring sugar with vanilla beans, the rinds of citrus fruits, coffee beans, chilis, you name it. How to make the flavored sugar depends on the ingredient you choose, but the basic theme is: take some of it and mix it with some sugar, put it in a jar and wait a few weeks. The results are transformative and delicious.
