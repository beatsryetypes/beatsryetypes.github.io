*Editors Note: Even with his fancy new mic, unfortunately, there were some problems with Aaron's recording. I did my best to salvage and clean but we had to cut a pretty significant section out around 21:00. I also had to leave in a little piece of damaged audio just to have the conversation make any sense.*
