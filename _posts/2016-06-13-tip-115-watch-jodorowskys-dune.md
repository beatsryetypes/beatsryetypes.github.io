Being people with the tendency toward _obsession_ we love stories of the _obsessed_ and one of our recent favorites is [_Jodorowsky's Dune_](http://jodorowskysdune.com/). After the requisite screening of [_El Topo_](http://amzn.to/1UqcVIB) in college, we were always in awe of the weirdness of Jodorowsky's films. Being avid Sci-fi readers and regular quoters of [_Dune_](http://amzn.to/234PcQh) the idea that these two could be linked and have made a film blew our minds. This is a stellar documentary and tells the tale of a series of the almost unbelievable team that _almost_ made one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.
