We love cellular automata - everything from the theory behind them that shows up all over Computer Science research, to their appealing visual presentation just makes us happy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld">Wireworld [WIKIPEDIA LINK]</a> is "a cellular automaton first proposed by Brian Silverman in 1987, as part of his program Phantom Fish Tank" and is more complex than you're used to if all you've seen for cellular automata is Conway's Game of Life. We first learned about Wireworld way back when from our friend and graphics afficionado <a href="https://twitter.com/maztik8r">Emil Ng</a>, and we haven't been able to get it out of our heads since. We'd love to see more implementations of Wireworld - maybe in JavaScript? Elm? On paper? We know you've got something for us, people of Beats, Rye & Types - let's see what you've got!
