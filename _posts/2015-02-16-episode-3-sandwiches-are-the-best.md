summary: |
  We consulted with each other, our spiritual leaders, our therapists, our significant others, and a host of other clerics and determined one thing: Sandwiches are The BEST. We talked about our favorite sandwiches from NYC, our home made opuses, and generally what makes a sandwich great. You might not want to listen to this without a sandwich in hand.
