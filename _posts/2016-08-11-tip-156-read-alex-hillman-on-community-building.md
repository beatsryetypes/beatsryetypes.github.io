As we discussed in <a href="http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2016/07/18/episode-48-we-are-back.html">a recent episode of our podcast</a>, we've been very interested in community building lately. One of our favorite places to read about building a community organically is <a href="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/">Alex Hillman's blog, Dangerously Awesome</a>. Alex is one of the founders of Indy Hall, a co=working space/community that has helped to shape and change the face of the modern workplace. Alex talks about getting your "first 10," the core group of people who make up your community, before worrying about renting a clubhouse and becoming a landlord. If you're looking to do any kind of community organizing, Alex's writing is an excellent place to start.
