The past year has brought a little bit of a revolution in veggie burgers. We were seriously obsessed with [Superiority Burger's](http://www.superiorityburger.com/) take on the vegan fast-food meal. Historically, veggie burgers we've tried at home have either been a hot mess (literally won't stay on the bun) or taste weirdly processed or off. We don't need our veggie burgers to be replacements for meat, we want something that has its own distinct (but good) flavor and texture, but one that still _acts_ like a hamburger in it's eatability. [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's Black Bean Burger Recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/03/the-best-black-bean-burger-recipe.html) has become our go-to after testing out a lot of different recipes. Its relatively easy to make, tastes great, and is satisfying on a Martin's bun.
