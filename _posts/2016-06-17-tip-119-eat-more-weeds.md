You may not be aware of it, but tons of the wild plants that we often refer to as weeds are actually not only edible but also good for you. For thousands of years humans took advantage of the plants that grew around them for food and medicine but at some point we lost a lot of that knowledge. Thanks to people like [Dina Falconi](http://amzn.to/1tuc1R8) (who gave us an an awesome foraging expedition at [Catskills Conf last year](http://www.catskillsconf.com/)), theres now great resources for discovering and "meeting" the plants that are wild all around you. Some wild edibles like ramps and fiddlehead ferns have gotten a lot of notoriety lately, but there are tons of other even more common ones that are are delicious and easy to find. Go hunting!
