Over the many many _many_ meals we've had at [Congee Village](http://congeevillagerestaurants.com/), we came to love the simply stir fried greens of many varieties that we'd order alongside our House Special Chicken. In the beginning these were just the palette cleansers, something that would be almost like an act of penance to the gods for all of the fried, battered, and braised meat we were about to consume. Over time, however, the greens became more of an equal part of the meal. They were often the first thing we would dig into. Being separated from the hallowed lazy-susans we once haunted, we have to make do at home. 

Cooking greens this style is lucky very easy. The only real requirement is finding fresh Asian greens - not just any _choy_ will do. Look for greens with tender stems like pea shoots, pak choy, or small "shanghai" bok choy. If you can only find thicker-rooted greens, separate the leaves from the greens and throw the greens in first.

- 1 Large bunch of tender asian greens, very well cleaned and separated into individual stems
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely minced
- 1 tbsp ginger, finely minced.
- 1 fresh green or red chili, sliced.
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 tbsp stock or water
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp oyster sauce
- 2 tsp fish sauce

Combine the stock or water and sauces in a bowl.

Heat a large wok and toss in the oil. Once hot, turn off the heat completely and add the garlic, ginger, and chili. Let simmer in the hot oil for about 30 seconds to a minute until you can really smell them.

Turn the heat back on and toss in all the greens. Work quickly to toss the greens with a tongs or large spatula, trying to coat each one in the oil. This will prevent them from all sticking together in a big clump. Once they have all changed color to a darker green throw in the mixed sauces, bring to a boil and let cook for about 2-5 minutes depending on the size and thickness of the greens. Turn out onto a large plate making sure to get all the collected sauce and garlic and the bottom of the wok.

Serve with white rice and whatever else you're cooking.
