It's September. Those tomatoes you were dreaming about back in May are now taking over your life. Your neighbor doesn't want any more of your tomatoes. Your family doesn't want any more of your tomatoes. What to do? <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/slow-roasted-tomatoes/">Smitten Kitchen has your back, as usual.</a> "Sun drying" tomatoes, especially small ones, in the oven is one of the most magically transformative things you can do in your kitchen. The intensity of flavor is beyond description - try them for yourselves and see!
