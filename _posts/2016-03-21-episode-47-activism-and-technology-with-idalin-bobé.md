summary: |
  Idalin is someone we've been trying for a while now to get on the show and talk to. Her talk at StrangeLoop this past Fall has been on our minds and a topic of conversation since. Her work in community building and outreach through technology is inspiring but her strong voice and perspective is something we feel like _our_ community of technologists needs.

Idalin is someone we've been trying for a while now to get on the show and talk to. Her talk at StrangeLoop this past Fall has been on our minds and a topic of conversation since. Her work in community building and outreach through technology is inspiring but her strong voice and perspective is something we feel like _our_ community of technologists needs. We got to talk about her feelings on the tech community in general, her roots in activism and tech, and more.

There was a little technical difficulty with this episode so please excuse AQ doing his shitty Ira Glass impression.
