Our good friend and JavaScript guru <a href="twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolen</a> told us to check this video out about a year ago, and we're just now getting around to watching it and appreciating it. Falcor is Netflix's take on how to efficiently model and fetch data on the web. The "One Model Everywhere" idea is very compelling, and with similar work from Facebook with Relay, and from David Nolen himself with Om.Next, we think change is coming in the game of front end data management. Are you ready for it?
