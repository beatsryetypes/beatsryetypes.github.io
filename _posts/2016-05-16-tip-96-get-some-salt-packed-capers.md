<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caper">Capers</a> are one of those foods that you hear a lot of people talk shit about.

"I don't like capers."

"Capers are gross."

Most of the time, when people say this, I assume that they've only ever tried capers backed in brine (which are still delicious, by the way). I say this because in my hear I believe that you *have* to love capers when they are preserved in a superior way: packed in salt.

Capers (the buds of the Flinders rose) packed in salt are intense, briny but not overwhelming, herbacious, and oh so delicious. Try them in pasta, with smoked salmon, in a sauce for pork, anywhere! Try them and love them!
