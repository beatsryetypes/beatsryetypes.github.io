summary: |
  In the first of many episodes where we drag some of our friends and colleagues on to talk with us, we leaned on our friend [Jed](http://jed.is) to talk about something we all share in common: Obsession. We're all united not by our obsessions themselves, but the fact that we're obsessed. This leads us on a great discussion of clear ice, sourdough, ceramics, and humanity itself.
