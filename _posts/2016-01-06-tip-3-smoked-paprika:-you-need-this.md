One of the best things you can do for your kitchen is throw out all of your old, nasty spices and buy new ones. When you’re out doing that, try to pick up some smoked paprika. It’s made by drying beautiful red sweet peppers over a wood fire, and the result is sweet, smokey, and a little bit spicy. We love it on boiled potatoes, in egg salad, on top of fish, on top of roasted veggies, or pretty much anywhere!
