As we've been diving into the Zahav cookbook, we were reminded of the amazing world of spice blending, and realized we had to tip about one of spice's contemporary masters: <a href="http://shop.laboiteny.com/collections/spices">Lior Lev Sercarz</a>. Sercarz runs La Bo√Æte, a company that sells very expensive, extremely fresh spices to restaurants and people who have some extra cash to throw down on things like fancy spice blends. If you do, that's awesome, and you should buy these. If you don't, you should liberally steal the blends that Sercarz has listed on his web page. Some of our favorites are those that Sercarz recommends for fish, like "Breeze No. 5" which mixes tea, anise, and lemon. Others like "Marrakesh No. 6" which combines cumin, cinnamon, and thyme, are evocative of places. All of the blends are worth playing around with, and ordering your own fresh spices and blending them together is very rewarding -- and delicious.
