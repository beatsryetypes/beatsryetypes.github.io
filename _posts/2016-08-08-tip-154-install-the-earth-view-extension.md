[Earth View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh) is a simple but awesome Chrome extension we discovered a few years ago that we appreciate constantly. All it does is show a satellite image from Google Earth every time you open a new tab. Seems simple, but the images that are presented are a constant reminder of how vast and beautiful the world is. We take it as a brief meditation every time we're about to switch contexts at work. The latest version also allows you to download and set the images as a background as well as jump to the location on the map. Warning: Sometimes this can turn into a very easy way to waste time.
