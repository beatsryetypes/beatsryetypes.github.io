While we're not really very intense about optimizing our local development setups for writing software, both of use some software that we couldn't live without. <a href="https://github.com/wting/autojump">autojump</a>, designed to reduce the number of keystrokes it takes to navigate to common directories, is one such tool.

autojump (which we alias to `j`) is fast, elegant, and easy to use. Install it and begin navigating as you normally would, and over time it will build a database which will allow autojump to easily guess which directory you're heading to next. On my laptop, `j p` brings me to the `pizzabook` directory, while `j P` brings me to my `Projects` directory. Awesome free tools with a great UX are few and far between. Trust us and use this one!
