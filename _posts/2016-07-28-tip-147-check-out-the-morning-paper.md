<a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/">The Morning Paper</a> is a fabulous resource produced by Adrian Colyer, which he describes as:

> "The Morning Paper: a short summary of an important, influential, topical or otherwise interesting paper in the field of CS every weekday. The Morning Paper started out as a twitter project (#themorningpaper), then it became clear a longer form was also necessary because some papers just have too much good content to get across in a small batch of 140-character tweets!"

Amazingly, Colyer started out with this lofty goal and has kept it up for some time. You can read his takes on everything from distributed systems to programming language theory and more. We're both big fans of reading academic papers, and believe that their impact, though often indirect, has been profound on the way think and solve problems. Join us!
