A couple of years ago, Calvin Trillin [wrote about a recently vanished New York institution, "Joe's Dairy".](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/02/mozzarella-story) It falls into a many categories we love: 1) Mozzarella 2) Great Food Writing 3) Stories of a vanishing NYC. AQ only visited Joe's Dairy once, but the memory is a strong one. An intense smell of fresh cheese, a counter that looked like is was about to fall apart, and some of the best mozzarella he ever tasted.
