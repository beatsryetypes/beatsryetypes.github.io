At this point, MRB and I have become seasoned tech speakers. It wasn't always that way, though. We got our start speaking at our local meetups, especially [NYC.RB](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/). Let's be clear, speaking at tech events (other than for the top 0.0001% most popular speakers) is not a lucrative career. It _is_ a great way to share ideas, meet people, and generally improve your public speaking and (maybe confidence). On our [Talk Talk Talk episode](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/06/08/episode-19-talk-talk-talk.html) we espoused that speaking at your local tech meetup is a great way to get involved - they usually have very accepting audiences and are also always looking for speakers. If you live in the Hudson Valley, check out [Dev O'Clock](http://www.meetup.com/hvtech/), or search for meetups in your area.
