Something about the heat of summer makes us want to:

- Smother everything in fresh herbs
- Drink tahini like its a water
- Cook everything over a live fire

Luckily, though we're late to the game, [Michael Solomonov's ZAHAV](http://amzn.to/2ae7Y6o) satisfies on all fronts. Even though AQ hasn't been in Israel for 16 years, every recipe here is like an amazing time machine back to simpler times. Even if you don't have the same personal associations we know that learning how to make the best hummus and shishlik is going to make your summer better.
