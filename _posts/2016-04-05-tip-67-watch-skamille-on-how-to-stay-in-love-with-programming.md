Our good friend, [Camille Fournier](https://twitter.com/skamille) is an ever-flowing font of wisdom and advice. She [writes](http://www.elidedbranches.com/) and [gives talks](http://www.camilletalk.com/) and was one of the [first guests on the podcast](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/04/20/episode-12-consenus-with-camille-fournier.html). We were [reminded today](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/717180022184939520) of Camille's [awesome talk at !!Con 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc8sc-ELMhA). As career programmers and sometimes managers and leaders, we sometimes need that reminder of why we love doing what we do and why we still do it despite frustrations. The video quality isn't great, but you can [check the slides here, too](http://www.slideshare.net/CamilleFournier1/keynote-talk-how-to-stay-in-love-with-programming).
