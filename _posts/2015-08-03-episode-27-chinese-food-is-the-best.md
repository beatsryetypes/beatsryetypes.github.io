summary: |
  A listener suggested we do a show about Chinese food, and we very happily obliged. We both have learned a lot about eating and cooking through the massive and rich cultural tapestry of Chinese culinary culture, so we share a bit about our history with American Chinese food, the idea of authenticity, how much we love spare ribs, and more.
