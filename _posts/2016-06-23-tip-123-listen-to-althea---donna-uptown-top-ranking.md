We are unabashed fans of all kinds of reggae music, from roots to dancehall to dub and back again. When we really feel like getting deep with a classic, we often reach for Althea & Donna's 1977 materpiece "Uptown Top Ranking." To think that the title track, rife with meaningful, penetrating social criticism, was once a Number 1 Hit in the UK is beyond mind boggling in 2016. There's not much more to be said about this album. If you haven't heard it, you absolutely  must. It will change the way you think about reggae if you think reggae is Bob Marley's Greatest Hits. If you're familiar with the album, you already know: you need another listen. It never, ever gets old. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1FWimRgPFwDVyVlHe9EEnP">[Spotify Link]
