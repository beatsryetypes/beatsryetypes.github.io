In light of the sad news today that [Phife Dawg has passed away](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/a-tribe-called-quests-phife-dawg-dead-at-45-20160323) we just want you to do something you should already be doing. We could make a playlist, but it would basically just be every Tribe album. The crazy thing about [Midnight Marauders](https://open.spotify.com/album/4v5x3Oo3UjQ9YmF3hRAip5) and [Low End Theory](https://open.spotify.com/album/1p12OAWwudgMqfMzjMvl2a) is that they are _perfect_ albums. You can listen to them back to back, over and over again and not get bored. When I (AQ) first heard   _Scenario_ and _Check the Rhime_ I was at home watching THE BOX and was obsessed with the energy and the beat. 20+ years later and I'm still listening to these albums like they just came out. So take the time today to _really_ listen and appreciate the days when Hip-Hop was jazz and there was a five-foot assassin in our midst. [#RIPPhifeDawg](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIPPhifeDawg).
