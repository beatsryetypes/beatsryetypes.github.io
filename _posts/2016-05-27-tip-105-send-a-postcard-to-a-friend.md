Email is great. SMS is cool, its got emojis. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, all fun. We love and use all of this technology every day, to keep in touch with our friends, family, and colleagues, and they work very well. None of them, though, come close to being capable of providing the joy we get when we receive a physical letter in the mail. Maybe it's because we're old, or romantic, or stupid, or all three, but we love physical things. We love hanging a postcard from a friend on our refrigerator, looking through boxes of old letters, and reminiscing. This weekend, as mrb heads to Toronto to celebrate the life and mourn the loss of James Golick, we thought a tip to help you love your loved ones even a little bit more was appropriate. Send a postcard today, and you might even get one in return. And besides, the front of your refrigerator is looking a little empty, isn't it?
