Since our relationship was cemented by our mutual love of hip-hop, it's very appropriate that our ONE HUNDREDTH TIP !!! should be a recommendation for you to listen to a hip-hop album. Chance the Rapper is a 23 year-old artist from Chicago, where many of our favorite musicians have hailed. We think his origins show in his music, and those roots run deeper than Kanye: his influences run far and wide. His recently released mix tape "Coloring Book" also known as "Chance 3" comes at the perfect time: when spring gives way to summer, that's when the people need music. The beats are fresh and the lyrics are too. We love this couplet:

> "I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom / Don't believe in kings, believe in the kingdom"

It's a good time to be in Chance's kingdom. We're not sure exactly how you should procure this album as of today, but <a href="http://chanceraps.com/">check out Chance's website for more information</a>. And thanks for following along through all of these tips - there's lots more to come.
