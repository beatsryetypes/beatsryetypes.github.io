The first time someone recommended that we check out the first <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4rNGFFaXZ7l0Vg6QrcHcUi">Secos e Molhados LP</a>, it didn't take very much convincing - the cover speaks for itself. The music is unexpectedly catchy, yet experimental enough to be interesting. This has become one of the hallmarks for us of Brazilian music - the sense of melody is undeniable, but it is never satisfied, always restless, always on to the next thing. You can find Secos e Molhados videos around too, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIyvM9Ce7mM">this one out for example</a>. We don't want to waste your time by trying to describe the music any further - just dig it.
