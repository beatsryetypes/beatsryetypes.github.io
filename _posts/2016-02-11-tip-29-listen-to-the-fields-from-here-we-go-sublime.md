Axel Willner, better known as The Field, released "From Here We Go Sublime" ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0qKWj1YPqY4pKBb0HPL2R6), [Amazon](http://amzn.to/1Q9DETn)) in 2007 on one of my all-time favorite electronic music labels, Kompakt. It flew under my radar even though extremely repetitive, minimal music based on glitched out samples and acid basslines sounds right up my alley. I'm basically mad at my friends for not telling me to listen to this earlier. Anyway, when anyone asks me what kind of music I like to listen to while working or writing, "From Here We Go Sublime" is always near the top of my list. It's extremely immersive music, and seems to make the whole world stand still around you. I like to picture the 10 tracks as 10 distinct long distance highway trips through imaginary landscapes: mountains of melting ice on the side of the road, densely falling leaves. You're trapped in the cabin of the car but you know you're moving. It will take 10 or 15 listens but soon this album will feel like an old, familiar soundtrack from somewhere deep in your memory.
