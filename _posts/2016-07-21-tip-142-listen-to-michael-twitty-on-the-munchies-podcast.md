We've been following [Michael Twitty](https://afroculinaria.com/) for a while now and are extremely excited for [his upcoming book, _The Cooking Gene_](http://amzn.to/2acMzca). We love food history, because it's the history of people and communities and Twitty is one of the truest historians of Southern food we've encountered. [His conversation with Helen Hollyman on the Munchies Podcast](https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/michael-twitty-addresses-racial-inequality-in-the-southern-kitchen) made us even more excited to read this history and watch him dive deeper into the past of his own family and the South.
