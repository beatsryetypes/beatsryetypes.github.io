We're not really in the business of trying to get people to buy expensive items for their kitchens. In fact, we recommend you get _most_ of your goods from a restaurant supply store as cheaply as possible. There are some things, however, that we love despite the cost. Our [Thermapen Thermometers](http://www.thermoworks.com/products/thermapen/) are at the top of that list. Sure, your $10 digital thermometer works _sometimes_ and you know the internal temperature of your food within a decent range. The first time we used one of these, we never looked back. Not only are they fast and relatively indestructible, but almost most importantly you can actually _read_ the display, even when its inside a grill or in the back of an oven. We've used it for BBQ, cheese, even doughs. Get one, you won't regret it.
