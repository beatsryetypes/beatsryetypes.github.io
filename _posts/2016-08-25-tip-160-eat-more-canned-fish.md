We weren't always into canned fish. We didn't understand what pleasures lurked beneath the strange metal tops.

But we have seen the light.

In the summer, when we hate to make any extra heat in the house, canned fish is a huge lifesaver. Open up some cans, get some fresh bread and cheese, some lettuce and tomatoes, make a simple dressing, and you have a perfect dinner.

Canned sardines from Portugal have been a favorite of ours, but we really do enjoy browsing the store shelves for types we've never tried. Some are funky and earthy, others light and barely smoked, but all are at least worth trying. Indulge.
