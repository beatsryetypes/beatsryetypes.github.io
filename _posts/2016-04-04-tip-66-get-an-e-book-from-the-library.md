Did you know that it's possible, even likely, that your local library has access to online services which allow library members to download and use e-books on portalble devices (or computers!) as a part of membership? It's true! And awesome! We've been taking advantage of this lately and realized that everyone might not know that this is is, as the kids say, "a thing." It makes our Elena Ferrante habit a bit more affordable, as well, which is always a good thing.
