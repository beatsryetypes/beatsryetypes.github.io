We reach for our copy of [_The Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook_](http://amzn.to/1Nq36DV) not when we're looking for recipes, but when we're looking to be inspired. Alice Waters was cool before you were born and her simple, unabashedly proud and passionate cooking was ahead of its time. The book includes sample complete menus from the restaurant ranging from the decadent (Champagne and Oysters) to bare ingredients at their finest (Ripe Figs with Goat Cheese). Probably our favorite part of the book is the introduction, which has guided our thinking about food:

> Cooking, preparing food, involves far more than just creating a meal for family or friends: it has to do with keeping yourself intact.

Word up, Alice.
