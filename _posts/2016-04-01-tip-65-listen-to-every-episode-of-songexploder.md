First of all, you know we're not going to be on some bullshit April fools stupidity. This is a legitimate tip that we are excited about.

Recently, we've been traveling a bunch and have had a lot of time to listen to OPP (Other People's Podcasts). One of our absolute favorites is [Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net/). It takes some of our favorite music and goes really deep and nerds out, letting the artist share their passion and creative energy about their work. The host [Hrishikesh Hirway](https://twitter.com/HrishiHirway) (who's a talented musician in his own right), manages to get out of the way and let the music and the artists do the talking. Some of our favorite episodes feature [Oneohtrix Point Never](http://songexploder.net/oneohtrix-point-never), [Thundercat](http://songexploder.net/thundercat), and [Tune-Yards](http://songexploder.net/tune-yards). Listen, it will make your Friday.
