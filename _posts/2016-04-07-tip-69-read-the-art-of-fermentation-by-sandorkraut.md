There are a few cookbooks on our shelves that we consider _more than_ books. These are _tomes_, volumes we treat as our guides to living in the kitchen not just collections of recipes. [Sandor Katz's](https://twitter.com/sandorkraut) [_The Art of Fermentation_](http://amzn.to/1qvMkyx) has reached bible like status in AQ's house as he has progressed from pickles, to bread, to cured meat and every ferment in between. Fermentation is one of our absolute obsessions - for it's resulting flavor as much as the pure magic of watching things be transformed by time. Katz's book is one of the most amazingly in depth studies that elevates the experimentation to truly an _art_. If you're not convinced, [watch this great short film about Katz and his work from the NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000003819616/sandorkraut-a-pickle-maker.html). Get fermenting.
