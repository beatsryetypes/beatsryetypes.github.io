Food history is one of our major obsessions and we love finding interesting stories about how and when traditional foods cross borders. [This fascinating long read by H.D. Miller about the history of Sushi in America](http://eccentricculinary.com/the-great-sushi-craze-of-1905-part-1/) was one of our favorite reads of the past year. It's unexpected, funny, and well-researched on top of being just straight-up interesting for anyone who cares about food in America. If you're interested in diving into the story of how sushi _works_ presently, we highly recommend the [_The Sushi Economy_ by Sasha Issenberg](http://amzn.to/1rhXgA8).
