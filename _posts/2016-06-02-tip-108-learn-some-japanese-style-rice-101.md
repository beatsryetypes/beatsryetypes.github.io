Recently we've become obsessed with the rice from <a href="http://www.kodafarms.com/japanese-styles-of-rice-various-types-forms-we-handle/">Koda Farms in California</a>. After picking some up at a local grocery store on the recommendation of several friends (and seeing it on the shelves of chefs we admire), we gave it a shot, and we cannot get over how delicious it is. Prepared in a rice cooker with no extra embellishment, Kokuho Rose rise from Koda Farms produces the most flavorful rice with the best texture that we've ever tried. While this style of medium grain rice isn't perfect for all applications, we highly suggest giving it a shot. It changed our minds about the quality of rice we could produce at home - maybe the same will happen to you. Koda has <a href=""http://www.kodafarms.com/japanese-styles-of-rice-various-types-forms-we-handle/">a guide on their site called "Japanese Rice 101"</a> which explains the different types of rice they deal with. Delicious and informative - that's Beats, Rye, & Types.
