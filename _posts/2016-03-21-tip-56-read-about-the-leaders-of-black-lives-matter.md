To get a little background for our [latest episode with Idalin Bob√©](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2016/03/21/episode-47-activism-and-technology-with-idalin-bob%C3%A9.html), this recent [_New Yorker_ article by Jelani Cobb](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/where-is-black-lives-matter-headed) paints an interesting picture of the history and possible future of a movement. Black Lives Matter came into existence in the turmoil around a series of very public and questionable murders of black individuals in inner cities across America. Now as the world is listening more than ever, we've approached an interesting inflection point - can this grassroots movement affect change in local and national government in a meaningful way - and will that even be enough to change the tide?
