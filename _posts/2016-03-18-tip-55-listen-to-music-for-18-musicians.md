It's no secret that when it comes to music, our tastes are not what you'd call ordinary. We've spent hours discussing our various musical obsessions with each other - everything from hip-hop (of course) to indie rock to jazz to traditional music from Indonesia, and beyond. One of our favorite albums that we return to again and again is filed in your record store (or should we say, assigned the category in iTunes?) under "Classical." [Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich) is one of the pioneers of what these days gets called "contemporary classical," "minimalism," and other funny labels, but we just call it straight up beautiful. If you don't know anything about Reich's work and you've never heard the album before, we recommend listening to it all the way through before you read about it. Listen to it, then read about how it is performed. If you're ever lucky enough to get to see a live performance of [Music for 18 Musicians](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Bgci6Tvx3sX9E4mPms19s) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJWO2FQ16c)) (MRB did, it brought him to tears), we highly recommend it. We're not going to spend any more time trying to describe this music - we're just going to say: listen to it. Like, really, really listen.
