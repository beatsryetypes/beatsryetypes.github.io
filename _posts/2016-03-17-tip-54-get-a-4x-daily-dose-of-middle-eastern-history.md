One of our favorite internet artists (we love the future) is Darius Kazemi, <a href="https://twitter.com/tinysubversions">better known as @tinysubversions on Twitter</a>. Darius has <a href="http://tinysubversions.com">created tons of awesome work</a>, <a href="http://feeltrain.com/">started a company that is like the one we'd like to work for when we grow up</a>, and generally has a shocking number of overlapping interests with us (he's also obsessed with hip-hop and Socialism). One of our favorite projects of his is a Twitter Bot (Darius' milieu, or medium, or whatever) called <a href="https://twitter.com/mideasthistory">@mideasthistory</a>, which tweets "Public domain photos from the Qatar Digital Library of Middle Eastern (& nearby) history" 4x per day. The images are beautiful, surprising, and also educational. Darius is on a mission to use technology to humanize and to "reintroduce serendipity," and this bot achieves both. In a cultural landscape which tends to dehumanize and demonize, where Islamophobia is rampant and violent racism on an upswing, this kind of serendipity and humanity is sorely needed. Gaze upon the great history of the Middle East, learn something, and pass it on. Only good can come of that. Bravo, Darius.
