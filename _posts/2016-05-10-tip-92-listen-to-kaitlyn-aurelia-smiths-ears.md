It's not really a secret that we have a thing for strange and beautiful electronic music. So far this year the album that's most captured our time and adoration is [Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith's _EARS_](https://open.spotify.com/album/5T9rGi62i1O7wRu3c2f3q4). There's something almost mystical and spiritual about the long drones mixed with soft distorted vocals. Her clear mastery of the synthesizers she uses (including the awesome [Buchla Music Easel](https://www.buchla.com/product/music-easel/)) is something to behold itself. She's mentioned in interviews that this album was inspired by one of our favorite films, Miyazaki's ["Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/). When you start to think of this as an alternate soundtrack to that movie, it somehow gets even _more_ awesome.
