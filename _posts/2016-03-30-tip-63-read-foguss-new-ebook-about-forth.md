We were very excited this week to see that one of the technical writers we most admire, [Michael Fogus](https://twitter.com/fogus) released his new eBook/Magazine, [Read-Eval-Print-Î»ove v003](https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove003/). This issue deals with the "odd-duck" of a programming language [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)). He talks a little bit about the history and the philosophy but then dives into a very interesting demonstration of an implementation of Forth in Ruby. We guarantee you will learn something - which is our #1 favorite thing to do.

You can read the whole thing for free online, but [you should cough up some dough and support Michael's work](https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove003/).
