We know [a thing or two about pizza](http://beatsryetypes.com/pizza), and you can trust us when we tell you that you should never cook the tomato sauce you’re putting on that pizza.[^1] Especially if you’re calling it a Margherita or want it to taste like that pie you had at Lombardi’s that time. Canned Italian plum tomatoes squished lightly with your hands makes the best pizza sauce you’ve ever had. Give it a shot.

[^1]: Regional styles notwithstanding, that is. If the pizza you grew up with relies on cooked sauce, we get it. We would do it too. We’re really talking about trying to perfect New York pizza at home.
