If you haven't been stuffing your face with corn for the past few weeks you're probably doing summer wrong. One of our go to summer corn recipes is [this classic David Chang number: Corn with Bacon and Miso Butter](http://www.gourmet.com/recipes/2000s/2006/10/cornmiso.html). It's hard to believe this recipe is 10 years old because it feels very _momofuku_ but timeless at the same time. Once you make and use your first miso butter (really just miso and butter combined) you'll want to slather it on everything.
