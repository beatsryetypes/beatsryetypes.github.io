Yukihiro Matsumoto, aka [Matz](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz), was on [one of our other favorite podcasts _The Changelog_](https://changelog.com/202/) this week to talk about the history, future, and some of his thoughts about the Ruby Programming language. Whether or not you love and work in Ruby, we think hearing creators and stewards of programming languages always have interesting things to say. We think of languages as having _philosophies_ and these often stem from the beliefs and desires of their creators. Ruby is no exception and it's always interesting to hear Matz talk about the _why_'s behind some of his design decisions.
