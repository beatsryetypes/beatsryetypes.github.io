It doesn't take any effort today to be aware of the violence and systemic racism that plagues this country. Even as people who grew up and remain under the safety net of white privledge, for the past many years its been obvious to us (and obviously we're not alone), that the rate at which people of color are murdered by police has roots in something much deeper. We can't begin to know the pain and the trials of being black in america today. The best we can do is continue to learn more, listen, and speak up when asked. We were greatly moved last year by reading [_Between The World and Me_](http://amzn.to/29Tlp8s) by Ta-Nehsi Coates. Again, it's not up to us to be able to identify by the father who warns his son in the book. We do feel, as parents, as Americans, and more importantly as _human beings_ that the stories and warnings that have to be told to black youth are a national problem and not one that any of us can ignore. #blacklivesmatter
