Something about these cold, blustery, and quiet days have us reaching for music that heightens, rather than changes those feelings. [Grouper's "Ruins"](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ElYoVUqRQIlDekD1v6aKa) is one of the most haunting and strange-emotion inducing albums of the past years. It's hard to call it music at times, more like an atmosphere. Occasional piano, signing, and rain as an instrument make us want to _lean into_ the cold and enjoy winter instead of pining for something else.
