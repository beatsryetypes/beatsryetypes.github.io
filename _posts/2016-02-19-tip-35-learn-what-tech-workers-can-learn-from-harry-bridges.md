<a href="https://twitter.com/_K_E_L_S_E_Y">Kelsey Gilmore-Innis</a> is a community organizer, tech provocateur, First Lady aficionado, and is also really good at Twitter and giving talks at tech conferences that you normally wouldn't see at tech conferences -- in other words, she's our kinda person. <a href="http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/blog/2016/01/06/what-tech-workers-can-learn-from-harry-bridges/">One of our favorite talks of hers is "What Tech Workers Can Learn From Harry Bridges"</a> which weaves together a personal history of San Francisco, an introduction to labor activist Harry Bridges, and ... JavaScript? Kelsey introduces us to Harry Bridges as a way of urging us to cast a critical eye toward our role in the modern technology-driven economy and the captal we generate. She says it best:

> "What I find increasingly urgent is for us to align ourselves with all of the other workers who generate that capital, whether they write docs, answer phones, serve food, drive buses, or clean conference venues. That alignment should be political, in our words and ballots; material, in our allocation of personal resources; and economic, in our purchases and career choices."

We're inspired by this message and hope you are too.

*As an aside, Kelsey is now working full-time on <a href="https://www.projectcallisto.org/">Project Callisto</a>, an amazing project designed to support survivors of sexual assault. It's fascinating technology to support a fantastic social mission. Check it out also!*
