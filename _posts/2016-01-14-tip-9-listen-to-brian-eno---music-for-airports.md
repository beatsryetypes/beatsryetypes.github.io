In the wake of the [sad news of one of our heroes passing earlier this week](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-dies-at-69.html?_r=0), we (along with a lot of the world) spent a lot of time listening to our favorite David Bowie records and songs. While he had amazing work in every part of his career, our favorites are his collaborations with another one of our idols, Brian Eno. If the only Brian Eno music you've heard is Bowie or Roxy Music related, we strongly urge you to check out as much of his catalog as you can. Today, we're enjoying the meditative sounds of one of his more abstract works [Ambient 1: Music For Airports](https://open.spotify.com/album/063f8Ej8rLVTz9KkjQKEMa) and we think you should, too.
