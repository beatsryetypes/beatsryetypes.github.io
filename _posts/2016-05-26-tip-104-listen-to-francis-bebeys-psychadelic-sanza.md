While exploring different regional African music this year, we stumbled on the work of Cameroonian musician, poet, and author [Francis Bebey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bebey). He recorded over 30 albums but the compilation [Psychedelic Sanza](https://open.spotify.com/album/3hhI4WjM655ryg6aHjqzp4) is what we've been listening to non-stop since we found it. It collects work from various periods of Bebey playing the traditional instrument, the Sanza (pictured), but then processed and mixed with synthesizers and other contemporary recording techniques. The result is meditative and hauntingly beautiful.
