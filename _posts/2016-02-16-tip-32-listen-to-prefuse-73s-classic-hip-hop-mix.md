A couple months ago one of our favorite artists ([Prefuse 73](https://twitter.com/prefuse73)), on our favorite labels ([NinjaTune](https://ninjatune.net/home)), [dropped a mix](https://soundcloud.com/ninja-tune/solid-steel-radio-show-1072015-hour-1-prefuse-73) of one of our favorite genres (Classic Hip-Hop) on one of our favorite radio shows (SolidSteel Radio). Needless to say we were excited. It's been a couple months but this mix has still been in regular rotation. We talked a bit ago [about why we love Hip-hop]() and this features some of the best tracks from some of our favorite artists (Black Moon, Big L, Gravediggaz, Juggaknots, just to name a few). We think it will put a rhythm to your Tuesday. [Listen to it all day today](https://soundcloud.com/ninja-tune/solid-steel-radio-show-1072015-hour-1-prefuse-73).
