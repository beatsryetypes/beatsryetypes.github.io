We love programming languages. We love that new ones come out all of the time, that boundaries are being pushed, that they represent both the achievements of our friends in research and the ones in industry. Programs are one of the most interesting and deepest forms of human expression (though we don't think they're anything at all like poetry), the languages that they're written in fascinate us, period. <a href="http://elm-lang.org/try">Elm is a programming language that wants you to be productive and happy</a>. It's taking some of the best research ideas in Programming Languages, and pushing them to the mainstream. If you're interested in more of the philosophy behind the language, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE">this talk by its creator is worth your time</a>. Try Elm and make something awesome!
