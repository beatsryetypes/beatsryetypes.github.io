London based artist, [Mo Kolours](https://mokolours.bandcamp.com/) released one of our favorite albums of 2015 (and a previous favorite of 2014). His music is an eclectic mix of African, electronic, folk, and found audio. The propelling rhythm and syncopation is what hooks us. Recently he started putting together a [Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/mokolours/playlist/4KrGNFuCV2ku30F9WlYCZn) of music that he's listening to. Its as varied and offbeat as his own music, but with a focus on some of the more interesting sounds of Africa and the Caribbean. The vibrant beats are making our week.
