Magnus Nilsson's [_Faviken_ Cookbook](http://amzn.to/1V7E3Nn) is one of our absolute favorites of the past couple of years. It belongs firmly to our 'aspirational cookbook' shelf - a collection of beautiful books about restaurants and food that because of ingredients, space, and especially skill we can never really hope to cook from. Though the recipes can't really be transformed into weeknight dinners, the philosophy and prose contained in these books can be highly inspirational. We talked about how _Faviken_ has been influencing us [way back in Episode 5](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/03/02/episode-5-perfection.html) and even after more than two years its still a book that we pull out often to get our creative juices flowing. Nilsson is the type of obsessive we aspire to be - focused, driven, but still filled with joy at the promise of what lies in the quest.
