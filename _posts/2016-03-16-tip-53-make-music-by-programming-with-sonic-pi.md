We love things that overlap more than one of our interests, and Sam Aaron's [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) hits a ton of them. Not only is it a way to programmatically make music, but it falls under a category of tools that can be used as ways to get young people involved and learning about programming. This is not just a pedagogic tool, though. Sam has used it to [perform live](https://vimeo.com/132813228) and it's a fully featured tool.
