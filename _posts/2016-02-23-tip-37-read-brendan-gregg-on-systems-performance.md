Technical writing can often be hit or miss, especially in a post-blog world, often technical material is dated by the time it is printed. [_Systems Performance_ by Brendan Gregg](http://amzn.to/1Q94Zpw), however, is a technical book that we learned an immense amount from and continues to be a book we reference. [AQ applied a lot of the learnings to his work](http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2015/06/15/ruby-performance-a-visual-guide/) to great success. Brendan works at Netflix these days and his work at [performance at mega-scale are fascinating](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2015-03-03/performance-tuning-linux-instances-on-ec2.html). Even if you're not working actively maintaining large systems, it's the philosophy of how to approach these problems that's really stuck with us.
