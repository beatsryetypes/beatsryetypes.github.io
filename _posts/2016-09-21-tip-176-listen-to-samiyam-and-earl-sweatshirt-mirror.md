We a) love almost anything that Stones Throw puts out and b) are consistently impressed by how much better [Earl Sweatshirt](http://earlsweatshirt.com/) gets with each track, so we had high expectations for [his track with Samiyam - "Mirror"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6TJaLcFheD9XjAvhltrQnC). Needless to say we weren't disappointed. The [creative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZcuwfiCjE) featuring Basquiat-esque visuals and animations is the first video in a while that we actually sat through entirely.
