<a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zach Lieberman</a> describes himself as "an artist, researcher, hacker dedicated to exploring new modes of expression and play." Zach uses code to produce beautiful, thought-provoking work, and even better - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman/">he often posts in-progress examples on his Instagram page</a>. Recently he has been playing with blobs, letters, lines, reflections, and more, and many of his examples can be reproduced using tools we all have access to - things like <a href="http://openframeworks.cc">Open Frameworks</a> and <a href="http://paperjs.org/">paper.js</a>. Zach is also one of the creators of the <a href=" http://sfpc.io">School For Poetic Computation</a>, the name of which is a fabulous distillation of what he does best: make poetry from code. As a former student of Zach's, mrb has come to admire him for his ability to pull in everything necessary, from academic research to code implementation and the literal, physical nuts and bolts to realize his work. We can't wait to see what he does next.
