We really, really, really love John Coltrane's music. It's been tough holding out on telling you to listen to him yet, but until then, we can tell you to watch him! After a recent bender that had us heavily rotating the records from Coltrane's "classic quartet" years, our friend and fellow obsessive <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_melnick/">Dan Melnick</a> recommended that we check out a documentary called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOJj4YXWPLI">"The World According to John Coltrane."</a> Focusing on the quartet years and later, the short documentary includes interviews with some of our favorite musicians: Wayne Shorter, Rashied Ali, Alice Coltrane, and even La Monte Young! Far out. The film mostly revolves around live footage, some light narration, and musician's impressions and recollections of the late, great giant. Though this movie is worth watching for the live footage alone, we also get to hear a lot about the relationship between Coltrane's music and the mysticism that interested him so deeply, that drove him from the beginning to create, create, create - and that is a real thrill.
