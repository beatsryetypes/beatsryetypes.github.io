We were beyond thrilled today to see the release of  <a href="https://policy.m4bl.org/platform/">The Movement For Black Lives Platform</a>. Here's what it's all about:

> "In response to the sustained and increasingly visible violence against Black communities in the U.S. and globally, a collective of more than 50 organizations representing thousands of Black people from across the country have come together with renewed energy and purpose to articulate a common vision and agenda."

The platform, web page, and accompanying resources outline at Local, State, and Federal levels what can be done to end the war on people of color in the United States. We've only begun to dig through it but we can already tell that this will be a materially transformative document. Be sure to click around and note the depth of research presented - this will keep us busy for a while.
