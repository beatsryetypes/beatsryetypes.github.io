<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic%C3%A1lia:_ou_Panis_et_Circencis">"Tropicália ou Panis et Circencis"</a> is more than a collaborative album, more than a compilation. It's more than music, in fact, and reaches beyond into politics, and all of humanities and the arts to define the voice of a generation. Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Tom Zé, Os Mutantes and Gal Costa, in 1968, in Brazil, combined to form the basis of a movement which would come to be known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic%C3%A1lia">Tropicália</a>. They would end up reaching much further, influencing and changing international music forever. It's one of our favorite examples of cultural high watermarks in one place rippling out into many others, and it's one of our favorite albums, period. The music is very hard to describe, but we know you'll want to join the revolution after just one listen.
