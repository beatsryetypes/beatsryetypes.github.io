One of our favorite cookbooks in recent memory is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tacos-Recipes-Provocations-Alex-Stupak/dp/0553447297">Tacos: Recipes and Provocations</a> by Alex Stupak and Jordana Rothman. We've waxed poetic about the book on our podcast, and at this point have cooked through a number of the recipes in the book, and haven't been disappointed at all, by a long shot. Though the salsas and fillings in the book are fabulous, by far the most empowering aspect of getting into it for us has been making our own tortillas. The book teaches you how to use a tortilla press, some masa, and some water to make the absolute best tortillas you've ever had. A lot like our stance on pizza, tortillas are just better when you make them yourself. Get your hands on some super tasty masa, and you're even that much closer to experiencing tacos how Stupak and Rothman so poetically describe them in the book. A tortilla press is cheap and will last you forever, and we guarantee you won't be disappointed. Give it a shot!
