I recently moved to Takoma Park, Maryland, a few hundred feet from where John Fahey grew up. It was actually a coincidence since I've been a long time fan of his work, and for the record, he hated growing up here and thought his house was haunted. Regardless, Fahey was one of the most original and brilliant American musicians ever, and he left countless documents of his sometimes tortured brilliance. ["Guitar Volume 4: The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party"](https://open.spotify.com/album/6my2BmFxBGgXlC1NTWCvNM) is one of my favorite examples of his work, a surprising, melodic, gripping journey through an imagined land at an imagined time. Fahey absorbed all of the American music that preceded him, and produced something striking and original. Give it a listen and see what I mean.
