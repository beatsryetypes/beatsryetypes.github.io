summary: |
  We're lucky to call awesome people who live across the ocean our friends. We especially love Mathias Meyer, CEO of Travis CI, who helped us score a hat trick of topics this episode. We talk about testing headphones, butchers in Berlin, finding balance as a manager, and how Europe is so different from the United States.
