Bobby Hutcherson is best known as a jazz vibraphonist - his albums for Blue Note are legendary for their range, spanning from hard bop to spiritual and vocal jazz and beyond. "Now!" finds Hutcherson paired with Harold Land and the vocals of Gene McDaniels and the results are thrilling. Deep, desperate, beautiful, and powerful, like all of the best jazz - and with a message. Check out "Now!" - now!
