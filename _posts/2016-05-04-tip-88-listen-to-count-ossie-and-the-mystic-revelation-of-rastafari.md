We recently came across <a href="http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/04/count-ossie-and-the-birth-of-reggae">this amazing David Katz piece on Count Ossie</a>, one of the most important figures in Jamaican music history. A deep, surprising, and fascinating story, it reminded us that we really needed to check out Soul Jazz's reissue of <a href="https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/count-ossie-the-mystic-revelation-of-rastafari-tales-of-mozambique">Tales of Mozambique</a>, a sprawling masterpiece that defies expectations and definitions. Recorded in 1975 by a collection of righteous mystics on their home turf, "Tales of Mozambique" is a tour of every corner of Jamaican music and we can't say enough about the melodies, the grooves, the rhythms, the lyrics. Peep it! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3SKr1MeYhsyDIrhX3opLiy">Spotify link here</a>.
