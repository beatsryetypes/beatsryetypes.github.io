This weekend we were reading about how [Woz created a BASIC from scratch for the Apple I](http://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636). One of the things that struck us was that a lot of the motivations for creating the original Apple were to be able to program and play video games. This launched us on some furious googling about the history of video games and landing on the wonderful [Pong-Story.com](http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm). Pong story is full of awesome information and pictures as well as itself being wonderfully nostalgic (for us at least) as a website. Theres something to be said for the fact that a lot of the innovation of early personal computing was driven by a desire to _play_.
