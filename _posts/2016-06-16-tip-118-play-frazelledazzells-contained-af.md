<a href="https://github.com/jfrazelle/">Jessie Frazelle</a> is one of our favorite modern computologists. She's a skilled hacker, an exemplary Open Source maintainer, a thoughtful writer, and is just generally hilarious. We're super into one of her many recent projects, a game designed to teach you about Linux capabilities and syscalls called (amazingly): <a href="https://contained.af/">contained.af</a>. We're far from security experts, but this seems like an awesome way to learn about security in the world of containers. Shout out to Jessie for her awesome work and for taking a new approach to security pedagogy - we could really use it.
