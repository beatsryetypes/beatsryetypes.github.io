[Rich Hickey's talk about Clojure and 'Complecting' - Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) is one we reference and think about a lot. Looking back at this I can't believe this talk is more than 4 years old now as I still think about it often. This week on the podcast [we talked to David Nolen](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2016/02/01/episode-45-ideas-and-octopus-with-david-nolen.html) who works with Rich now and definitely embodies the ideas that Rich puts forward. In a world where systems and tools are become _more_ instead of _less_ complex, its interesting to talk and think about where and why complexity originates. Whether or not this makes you jump to use Clojure, its a fact now that the methodology and ideas that were presented in this talk have reached far beyond into other ecosystems and languages.
