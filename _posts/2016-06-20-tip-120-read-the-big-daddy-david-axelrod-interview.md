<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod_(musician)">David Axelrod (the musician and producer, not the political strategist)</a> is a notoriously prolific and cantankerous personality who probably produced a lot of music that you've heard, even if you didn't know it. We first heard his name back our crate-digging days of the 1990s, when his records were impossible to find and his mystique was at its peak. Axelrod has graced the dover of the awesome <a href="http://waxpoetics.com">Wax Poetics magazine</a>, and though that absolutely epic interview isn't available online, an <a href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/features/articles/david-axelrod-part-1">almost equally epic interview from the now defunct 'Big Daddy' magazine</a> has been made available. If you're a fan of rock, jazz, or rap music, you need to hear Axelrod's stories. They're almost too much to be believed.
