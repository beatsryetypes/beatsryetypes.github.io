summary: >
  We sit down with one of the people we admire most in <strike>NYC tech</strike> general, Camille Fournier. We get to talk about the typical things around Consensus: What's up with it, Why it's a hard problem, and how managing people is like managing process (or isn't at all). If that doesn't sound appealing, may I interest you in Steak Tartare?
