This sounds like a very self-serving tip (and how!) but it's been [exactly a year since we launched this here enterprise](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/02/01/episode-1-first-experiences.html) and we couldn't be more proud of what we accomplished. We talked to some of our favorite [programmers](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/05/18/episode-16-fatherhood-with-andrew-gerrand.html), [designers](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/09/21/episode-32-graphical-design-with-rob-carmichael-(aka-seen-studio).html), and [pizza queens](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/05/26/episode-17-portland-pizza-with-sarah-minnick.html). We talked about [sandwiches](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/02/16/episode-3-sandwiches-are-the-best.html), [socialism](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/07/06/episode-23-free-as-in-free-puppy.html), [sadness](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/09/28/episode-33-on-failure.html), and just about everything in-between.

So Happy Birthday to BRT, and raise a glass of whatever you fancy with us tonight.
