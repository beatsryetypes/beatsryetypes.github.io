In a search for tool-kits for building synthesizers (a fun project that combines our love of computers and music) we stumbled on the work of [Peter Blasser](http://petermopar.blogspot.com/) and his project, [the Shnth](http://shbobo.net/). The Shnth is a unique instrument that is somewhere in between a synthesizer and a mystical forest lute. What really got us was [Peter's often psychedelic and poetic descriptions of his intentions with the Shnth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrteFb3R9M). We hope to get our hands on one someday.
