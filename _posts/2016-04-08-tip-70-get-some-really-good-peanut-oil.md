Sometimes, we're not very smart. For instance, we've known for years that there's a difference between regular olive oil and REALLY GOOD olive oil. There's lots and lots and lots of different grades. We knew this, but we didn't apply it to something obvious - EVERY OTHER KIND OF OIL! Recently we've gotten really into having a bottle of flavorful, fresh peanut oil around for all different purposes. You can fry an egg in it, crisp up some boiled potatoes, or even use it in salad dressings. Dress some noodles. Put it on a pizza! Give it a shot, it's super delicious and the results can be surprising.
