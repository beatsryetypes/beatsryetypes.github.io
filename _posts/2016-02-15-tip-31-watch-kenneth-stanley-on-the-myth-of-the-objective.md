[Kenneth Stanley's talk _Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQPL9GooyI) from earlier last year came across our desks this weekend and it was ripe for sharing. He goes through some of his research around evolving AI's and how the failure of this research led to some very interesting general discoveries about the nature of science and goals themselves. We haven't read [his book yet](http://amzn.to/214DqVD) but we know if fits right in the BRT zone of learnings from computology that might have reaches beyond the field.
