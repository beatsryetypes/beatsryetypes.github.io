We've been listening to [Dâm Funk's](https://www.stonesthrow.com/damfunk) strange and melodic modern funk music since 2009's [_Toeachizown_](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ewQFqJuTZSW5MOI3QYShl). We discovered it, because we will listen to anything StonesThrow puts out, but we're happily surprised with how different and fun it was. Now he's put out a mix as part of one of our favorite series [Dj Kicks](http://www.dj-kicks.com/damfunk/) and we are not disappointed. This is perfect summer-cruising-with-the-top-down music. Jam it even if you're sitting inside working on your computer, maybe just turn a fan on and pretend its a breeze.
