One of our favorite restaurants when we lived in NYC was Brooklyn's <a href="http://www.no7restaurant.com/">No 7.</a>. We were very delighted when they opened their sandwich restaurant called "No 7. Sub" in Manhattan not too far away from our office, and  it too, quickly became a favorite. We were very excited to hear that Tyler Kord released a cookbook, <a href="http://no7sub.com/asuperupsettingcookbook">A Super Upsetting Cookbook About Sandwiches</a>, and it reminded us of one our favorites, the broccoli sandwich. <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2013/06/a-sandwich-a-day-the-broccoli-at-no-7-sub.html">You can get more of the details on that sandwich here</a>, or you can buy the cookbook, or you can now live your life enlightened with this new information: that broccoli can make an excellent main ingredient for a sandwich. Try it. Be forever changed. Thank Chef Kord, buy his book, and spread the gospel.
