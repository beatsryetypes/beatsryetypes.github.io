We wish we could have been at the _Velocity Conference_ a couple of weeks ago to see [Charity Majors deliver this great talk about making good technical choices](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/a-young-ladys-illustrated-primer-to-technical-decision-making). If we were there we probably would have been nodding our heads so loudly that you could have heard it on tape. We love Charity for the humor and snark she brings, but honestly, we couldn't agree with her methodology for choosing reliable technology more.
