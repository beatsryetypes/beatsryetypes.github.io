On this #tbt, we're in disbelief that its been 10 years since J Dilla (aka Jay Dee) released [_Donuts_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7lXgEecCoWkW1Lvf2jpN4y), possibly _the_ definitive instrumental hip-hop album. It might not seem that long ago because we've listened to it consistently since then. At the time of it's release, we were serious "Stones Throw" heads, having absorbed everything from Quasimoto to PB Wolf to Lootpack. _Donuts_ felt like it came from the same vein, but it was different. It had a driving force, a relaxed urgency that instantly put you some where late night, windows down, feeling like the world was irrelevant as long as you had _the beat_. This album has tracks, but they're just suggestions of where to drop a needle if your in a rush. This is a front-to-back listen and ideally one when you have nothing else to do but enjoy it.

R.I.P Jay Dee.
