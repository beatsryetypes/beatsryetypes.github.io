When we heard that Theo Parrish, one of our favorite producers, was releasing a mix of music from the Black Jazz label, one of our favorite jazz record labels, we were beyond stoked. It turned out that we should have been even more stoked because as usual Parrish exceeded our expectations. This mix is both a fabulous introduction to the Black Jazz catalogue and a testament to Parrish's delicate artistry. This is beautiful, inspiring, soulful music that reminds us of just how deep music can be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0oyKdUtdHSoCtmSulrr2f7">Spotify Link Here</a>
