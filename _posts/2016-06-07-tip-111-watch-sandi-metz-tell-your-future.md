Even though its almost two years old, [Sandi Metz's talk from RubyConf 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOM5_V5jLAs) has stuck with us. In it, Sandi - one of our all time favorite technical speakers - tells us the story of the LinoType and how an entire industry was quickly outmoded and disappeared overnight. Regardless of what language, framework, or platform you use, this is a lesson about how things change. Believing that what you have now will last for ever is a mistake. [The talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOM5_V5jLAs) is moving and the entire crowd watching it (AQ was there) was overwhelmed with feelings.
