AQ doesn't have a decent Chinese takeout place where he lives now. This is somewhat of a travesty since we spent most of our life eating out of white cartons. We've slowly found recipes to replicate our favorite dishes, and [The NYTimes Cold Sesame Noodles Recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9558-takeout-style-sesame-noodles) is one that when made correctly, is actually better than the version you get from your local place. Its also a great recipe for an easy summer dinner since it requires so little cooking.
