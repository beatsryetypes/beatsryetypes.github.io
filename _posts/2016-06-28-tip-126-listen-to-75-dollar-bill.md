We all have friends that recommend music to us - sometimes we take their advice, and sometimes we don't. We all also have friends that seem to always be right on the money when they tell us we should check something out. For us, Steve Lowenthal, proprietor of the amazing <a href="http://www.vdsqrecords.com/">VDSQ Records</a>, is one of those people. Whenever he says "hey dudes, check this out," we do just that. And that's how we came across this awesome gem - 75 Dollar Bill's "Wood / Metal / Plastic / Pattern / Rhythm / Rock." Spread over four tracks of rough, jangled guitar, distant percussion and the occasional deranged horn, "W/M/P/P/R/R" came as a big surprise for us when we started spinning it, and now we just can't stop. There's an East Coast edge here, like a Velvets-y take on 70s German Commune rock, but really, it's all love. What a fabulous piece of music, what a fabulous time to be alive. Go check it out right now! <a href="http://www.thinwrist.com/#!twj---75-dollar-bill-wmpprr/cx6c">[Buy it from the Label here]</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4wB3QFYqn8JEVWG84Ye61A">[Spotify Album Link Here]</a>
