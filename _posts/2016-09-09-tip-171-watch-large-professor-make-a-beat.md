If you've never watched a beat getting made before, its a pretty fun process to watch. A producer takes some records from a crate, takes different elements - drums, vocals, horns, even just static - and crafts them into something new and sometimes untraceable to the source. If you're going to get a lesson in how it's done, look no further than one of the legends [Large Professor doing his thing on an MPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w0vv8BqRcw&list=PL_QcLOtFJOUgNxURr8B4lNtf_3e9fWZzl&index=27). He makes it look too easy. If you like this, the whole [Rhythm Roulette series is very fun to watch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QcLOtFJOUgNxURr8B4lNtf_3e9fWZzl).
