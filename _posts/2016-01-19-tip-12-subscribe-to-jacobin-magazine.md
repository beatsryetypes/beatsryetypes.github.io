<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/socialism-train/">Jacobin</a> was one of our favorite discoveries of 2015. We ended up discussing articles from the magazine, self-described as "a leading voice of the American left," in more than one episode of <a href="http://beatsryetypes.com/podcast/">our podcast</a>, including:

* <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/05/slow-food-artisanal-natural-preservatives/">"A Plea for Culinary Modernism" by Rachel Laudan</a> - a piece that will change how you look at "artisinal food"
* <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/07/starving-artists-grizzly-bear-poverty-ubi/">"Culture Isnâ€™t Free" by Miranda Campbell</a> - discussing the role of the artist in modern times

...amongst others. A well written, well researched, well reasoned magazine which also has flawless design and a fearless attitude? What more could you ask for? They could use your support <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/subscribe/">so subscribe if you can</a>!
