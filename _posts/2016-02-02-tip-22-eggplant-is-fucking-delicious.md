Growing up, I wasn't much for eggplant. The only time I ate it was in an the occasional eggplant parm hero, which can hardly count as eating eggplant, as I'm pretty sure a dirty sock parm hero would taste awesome if it were cooked properly. I avoided baba ghanoush, shunned eggplant salads, derided the weird lumpy vegetable in all of its forms.

Guess what? Like most things, I was wrong to avoid eggplant. So very, very wrong, because eggplant is fucking delicious. Eggplant takes work to cook properly, is easy to mess up in a variety of ways, and the multitudinous varietals and cooking methods don't help demystify things. But be sure, it is extremely fucking delicious and anyone saying different just probably hasn't had the pleasure.

If you want to cook eggplant at home, reach for the greats. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotam_Ottolenghi">Yotam Ottolenghi's</a> books have the most delicious and easiest to prepare eggplant dishes I've had in a long, long time.

If you want to eat eggplant and worship at it's altar, make your way to Brooklyn, NY and get a hero that has the fried eggplant (pictured above) in it at <a href="http://defontesofbrooklyn.com/">Defonte's of Brooklyn</a> for lunch. Then head to Woodside for dinner at <a href="http://sripraphairestaurant.com/">SriPraPhai</a> and order a fragrant curry, where you'll likely find eggplant in a completely different context, of a completely different kind. Your spiritual eggplant journey completed, head home a changed person, and pass the message of deliciousness on to the next generation.
