We love when a talk at a conference silences and audience and makes them think - when the power of the speakers voice and words forces them to consider there own place within the room. AQ got to see [Stephanie Morillo](https://twitter.com/radiomorillo) [deliver this talk about the inequality that exists and we try to ignore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9PRaM29lJg) last summer and was blown away. Not only was she deeply honest and reflective, but her words were direct and didn't hold back. We later [invited Stephanie on the podcast where we talked about music, food in the bronx, and "being yourself" in tech](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/10/12/episode-35-the-timbre-of-technology-with-stephanie-morillo.html). Take 20 minutes to [watch the talk and think about how tech might divide while it unites.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9PRaM29lJg)
