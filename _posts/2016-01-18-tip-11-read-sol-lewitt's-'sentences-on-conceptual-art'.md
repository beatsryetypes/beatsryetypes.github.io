Beginning with

and ending with

> "These sentences comment on art, but are not art."

<a href="http://www.altx.com/vizarts/conceptual.html">Sol Lewitt's "Sentences on Conceptual Art"</a> reads like something between a psychedelic software specification and a recipe in a cookbook for imaginary food. We were reminded of this when our pal Maggie Zhou asked on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What&#39;s the most influential thing you read, after the age of 21?</p>&mdash; Maggie Zhou (@zmagg) <a href="https://twitter.com/zmagg/status/688829264574173184">January 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

We thought about reading this in college, and the influence it had on a generation of artists who were looking for a way to take art off of the walls of galleries and museums and into the lives of people, where it belongs. Lewitt is one of our favorite artists, and if you get a chance to see his work in person, you should - no photographs can do it justice.
