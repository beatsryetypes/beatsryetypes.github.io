We were both lucky enough to be around New York City during one of the resurgences of indie hip-hop greatness: the late 90s. The epicenter of this movement was Fat Beats, an unassuming second floor record store that was considerably less popular than the hot dog joint that it was next door too (though to be far - this was an amazing hot dog joint). We had an awesome time <a href="http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/05/fat-beats-oral-history">reading this oral history of Fat Beats</a>. Check it out and then seek out any of the music from that period that you're not familiar with. You'll find music that is real, artistic, and raw, just like how we remember NYC at the time.
