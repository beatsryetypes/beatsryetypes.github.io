We're big fans of early science fiction (what we've sometimes heard referred to as Ray Bradbury referred to as 'The Fiction of Ideas') and one series that we've come back to over and over again is [Isaac Asimov's _Foundation Trilogy_](http://amzn.to/2ahqERH). The premise of a future civilization that has to recreate itself from the ground up has since been copied an infinite number of times, but theres something about the story telling and the characters in Asimov's world that keeps us coming back. One of our favorite things about this series is that it was written in an age before personal computers means that the advanced technology described was envisioned in a complete alternate timeline when 'technology' wasn't just how small you could make a CPU.
