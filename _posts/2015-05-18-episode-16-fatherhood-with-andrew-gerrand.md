summary: >
	We spend a lot of time thinking about and caring for our sons and daughters so we enlisted the expertise of one of our good friends and "Old Dad", Andrew Gerrand ([@enneff](https://twitter.com/enneff)) to talk to us about Fatherhood. In this case we get to touch on fatherhood as it relates not only to our actual progeny, but also as the stewardship of a major open-source project (Google's Go language #golang).
