Philip Cohran is an example of a jazz musician who you may not have heard of but who has most certainly shaped the history of jazz. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Cohran">His story is too long to tell here</a>, but as a veteran of Sun Ra's Arkestra for 10 years before he released his own music, you know that he had the chops, the vision, and the ... whatever it is you need to be able to say something as original and expressive as what Cohran has managed during his long and amazing career. The work collected as "...and the Artistic Heritage Ensemble" covers some incredibly effusive, soulful jazz music that Cohran made in the late 60s with some very talented collaborators. If you're looking for some deep soul on a dark day - this should be your pick.
