_[The Frankies Spuntino Kitchen Companion & Cooking Manual](http://amzn.to/20YEJp4)_ or as it's affectionately known in our houses "The Frankie's Cookbook", is by far the #1 cookbook we buy for people, recommend, and consistently cook from. This is not an accident or some sort of pure nostalgia (though we both do love going to Frankie's 457 and have shared many a memorable meal there). The Franks (with one of our cookbook role models, Peter Meehan) produced a book that is not only fun to read, with memorable quips and a defined voice, but also has some of our all time favorite recipes. The Meatballs alone are worth buying the book for (though [you _can_ find the recipe online](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/meatballs-the-spuntino-way-360130)) but also the cavatelli, the ravioli, the salads, and especially the tomato sauce have all become regular rotation items in our houses. If you want to make a special Valentines meal for your significant other, make them something rich and tomato-y.
