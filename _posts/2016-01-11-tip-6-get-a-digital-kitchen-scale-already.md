If you plan to make [Pizza](http://pizza.beatsryetypes.com) or really do any kind of baking a digital kitchen scale is a hard requirement. [SeriousEats has a good breakdown of why measuring dry ingredients by volume is a bad idea](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/how-to-measure-wet-dry-ingredients-for-baking-accurately-best-method.html). AQ has had [this scale for more than 6 years](http://amzn.to/1OcNHZP) and uses it every day for his pour over coffee routine (more about that in a later tip, I'm sure). A good scale makes making doughs and other baking something consistent and fool-proof.
