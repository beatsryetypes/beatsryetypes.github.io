We're huge fans of Harold McGee. His writing on the intersection of food and science was one of our biggest inspirations in the style and content of <a href="http://pizza.beatsryetypes.com">The Pizza Book</a>. McGee's epic tome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Food_and_Cooking">On Food and Cooking</a> is a must-have for your kitchen library. Read about the origins of grain and bread, for example, and you'll never look at food the same way again. In terms of psychedelic investigations of food and perception, however, McGee's <a href="http://luckypeach.com/perception-vs-reality/">Perception vs. Reality</a> article from <a href="http://luckypeach.com/">Lucky Peach</a> is pretty much tops. McGee breaks down how the chemicals in food result in impulses in your brain is absolutely fascinating. From the history of food to how it works in your brain, McGee covers it all. Read this piece and then devour the rest of his work!
