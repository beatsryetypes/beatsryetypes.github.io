We spend a lot more time in the dusty crates of jazz vs the more contemporary artists, but once in a while an artist puts out something modern and interesting in its own right. We were a little late to the Vijay Iyer parade, learning about him from [a great profile in _The New Yorker_ earlier this year](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/01/time-is-a-ghost). His work with his trio is our favorite, including 2012's [_Accelerando_](https://open.spotify.com/album/2FaaNlVFsJ74lmrOazjZFF) and some great live recordings like this interpretation of MIA's [_Galang_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOBhrnOzwXw).
