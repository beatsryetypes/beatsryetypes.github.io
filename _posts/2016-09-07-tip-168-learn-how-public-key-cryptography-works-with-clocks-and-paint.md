Cryptography is one of those subject areas that even wizened computer programmers seem to be afraid of. We certainly don't consider ourselves security experts and have never quite understood what "curves" have to do with security. We do love visual explanations, though, and metaphors work great for us, so we finally had an a-ha moment about how public key cryptography works when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QnD2c4Xovk">watching this awesome video</a> that uses paint mixing and clocks to explain one way functions, modulus math, and more! Check it out and learn about this crucial (and pretty miraculous!) yet little understood corner of technology.
