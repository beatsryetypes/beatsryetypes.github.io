Though we have our own strong political beliefs that we've expressed in different forms throughout our posts and shows, we care more about having the democratic process work. This means that even if you feel like the game is rigged and you feel unrepresented in the group of candidates, it's your duty to go out and vote. The deadlines for registration are coming up in most states so we urge you to [get registered](https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote). In this election, especially, even individual primary votes are making a difference. Take the 10 minutes to fill out a form, please.
