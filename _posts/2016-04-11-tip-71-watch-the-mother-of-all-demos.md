On December 9th, 1968, Douglas Engelbart gave a demonstration at the Joint Computer Conference's Fall edition in San Francisco that set the tone and pace for progress in modern personal computing for decades to follow. Engelbart, who died in 2013, is in his element in this demonstration, powerfully commanding an interface with a mouse and keyboard to show all kinds of magic tricks - text manipulation, video conferencing, linked documents, and more. It's often instructive to look backward at the foundations of a field to measure and assess progress and this is no exception. We can learn volumes about where to go and what to do by seeing what we've accomplished from Engelbart's vision and what we haven't. Even if you don't build computer systems, watching chunks of this demo is a must - it's a creative genius at one of his many peaks.
