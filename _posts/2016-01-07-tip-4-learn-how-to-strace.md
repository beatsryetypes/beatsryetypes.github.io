If you're a developer who writes code for production, your day job is probably more aptly titled "Debugger". Regardless of what language you program in, if you run your code on linux-flavored systems, you may or may not know that there are tons of tools you can use that are baked in to your OS. One of the perennial favorites (but often misunderstood) tools is [`strace`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace). Lucky for you some awesome people have put together some great resources for learning it. Our friends at [packagecloud.io put together a great cheat sheet](http://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2015/11/15/strace-cheat-sheet/) and the ever-awesome [@b0rk](http://twitter.com/b0rk) published [a free strace zine](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/04/14/strace-zine/). We promise the investment is worth while.
