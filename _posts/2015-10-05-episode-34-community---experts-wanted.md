summary: |
  As MRB returned from Strangeloop 2015 we talked about some of the more interesting aspects of the conference. Specifically it raised questions for both of us about what makes a community and what is the work in building one. We had a lot of questions but not many answers so we're looking for experts to join us in the future and point us in the right direction.
