summary: |
  A very special episode: We sat down IN PERSON for the first time as part of the podcast and talked about a variety of things on our minds. AQ accidentally did not hit record on the first try, but we ended up taking a slightly different track anyway. We talk about overturning dogmas and preconceptions about the food we like and cook, and generally the things we believe to be true.
