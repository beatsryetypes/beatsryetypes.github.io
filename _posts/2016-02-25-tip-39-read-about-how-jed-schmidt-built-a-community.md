About a year ago we had our first guest on the podcast - our friend, [the inimitable Jed Schmidt](http://beatsryetypes.com/episodes/2015/03/23/episode-8-obsessions-with-jed-schmidt.html). Even though we spent most of the episode talking about perfect ice and ceramics, Jed worked for the past few years doing something we talk about often: building a community. Jed co-founded and ran Brooklyn.js, one of the most thriving tech groups in NYC, [and he recently reflected on how that all happened](https://github.com/jed/building-brooklynjs). There are some great tips in here around creating and improving positive tech communities as well as some good ol' reminiscing. [Check it out](https://github.com/jed/building-brooklynjs).
