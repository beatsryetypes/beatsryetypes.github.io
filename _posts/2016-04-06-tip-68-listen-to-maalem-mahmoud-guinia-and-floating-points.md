[Floating Points _Elaenia_](https://open.spotify.com/album/51QBkcL7S3KYdXSSA0zM9R) was one of our favorite albums of last year, so we were double stoked when we discovered [his recordings with famed Moroccan musician Maalem Mahmoud Guinia](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Ui5FMje2UiaVPf6XmveUN). We love collaborations between musicians of different backgrounds and styles and this album does not disappoint. [You can also watch some live footage captured by The Boiler Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6blGJldtGWw) that shows how virtuosic the playing is.
